#Setup

To use this program, the following software should be installed. This has only been tested on Windows 10, but other version of Windows should work (and perhaps other OSes as nothing is particularly OS specific).

1. Install Anaconda Python 2.7 64bit (32 might work, haven't tested) from https://www.continuum.io/downloads
2. Run the following command:

    `pip install plotly argparse`

3. (optional) Install PyCharm Community Edition from https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/
4. Download this repo as zip (https://github.com/kevroy314/iKidsNewbornCognitiveVisualizer/archive/master.zip) and unzip in a known location or call git clone
