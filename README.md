To use this program, the following software should be installed. This has only been tested on Windows 10, but other version of Windows should work (and perhaps other OSes as nothing is particularly OS specific).

Install Anaconda Python 2.7 64bit (32 might work, haven't tested) from https://www.continuum.io/downloads
Install Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7 from http://aka.ms/vcpython27
Run the following command:

pip install PySide pyqtgraph colour tzlocal PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate argparse

(optional) Install PyCharm Community Edition from https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/
Download this repo as zip (https://github.com/kevroy314/Holodeck-Time-Travel-Task-Analytics/archive/master.zip) and unzip in a known location or call git clone
Either open Main.py or PathVisualizerAnimated3D.py in PyCharm and click the Green Run Arrow or navigate to the unzipped path in a command prompt window and call "python Main.py" or "python PathVisualizerAnimated3D.py".
